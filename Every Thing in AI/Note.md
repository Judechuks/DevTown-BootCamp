## NOTE FROM DEVTOWN BOOTCAMP
## LEARN EVERYTHING IN AI
The coding platform used was **colab** (website/software). 
You can access colab using mobile phones and it helps you to prevent computer burnt. since some of the codes require a lot of resources. Hence colab (owned by google) provides you the required resources, by running the code from their end and delivering the output to you.
The bootcamp started from 28/4/2023 and ended 6/5/2023

## DIRECTIONS
#### 1. Open colab through this link: **[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)**
#### 2. Click on the Github tab
#### 3. Copy and paste this link: (https://github.com/Devtown-India/Python-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Important_concepts_in_python.ipynb) in the search input box of colab and click on the search icon
#### 4. Click on connect at the top right side of the window
#### 5. Go through the notes and click on the play button to run the programs
#### 6. Click on the link demacation, two button will show up, click on code to write code snippets
#### 7. To run the code click on the play icon or press (Shift + Enter) or (Ctrl + Enter) key on your keyboard

## CODING THE TIC TAC CODE
#### 1. Open colab through this link: **[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)**
#### 2. On the current tab click on 'New notebook'
#### 3. It generates a name for your program, you can rename it. (tic-tac-toe.ipynb)
#### 4. Write the code attached to this Note
#### 5. Execute the code by clicking on the play icon or (Shift + Enter) key
#### 6. Also execute the snipet code "main()" that will call the code in Step 5 by clicking on the play icon or (Shift + Enter) key

## TIPS ON PLAYING THE GAME
The game was developed using the MIN MAX Algorithm. The game is designed in a way that you can't win the AI. You either draw or lose.
The same input always give you the same output (i.e. if you take the same procedure or steps you will always achieve the same result).

**HINT: (PLAYING TIC TAC TOE WITH AI)**
#### 1. Always start with the 5 to draw the game if you are the second player (player 2) with AI.
#### 2. Never start with (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9) position if you are the second player (player 2) with AI.
#### 3. If you are the first player, always start with position 1 or 5 to draw (because you can never win the game over AI.)
